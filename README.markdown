# Gruf 

A collection of scripts to help productivity when dealing with
Projects.  Probably only applicable to those of us working from the
command line and without an IDE.

1. Source gruf.bashrc from your .bashrc
2. Source gruf.vimrc from your .vimrc
3. Add $GRUF_PROJECT to your $PATH
4. Modify gruf.bashrc to your liking (optional)
